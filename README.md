# Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis
Hello everyone!
Play Store App Review Analysis project is done by me. This is my first project done by using python. In this colab notebook I'm gonna analysis the play store app raviews and rattings. I'll analysis which app have more downloads and which app have more reivews or ratting. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data, which consists of two files:

playstore data.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
