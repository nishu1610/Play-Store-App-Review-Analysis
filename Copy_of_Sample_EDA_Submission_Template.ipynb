        "**Category** - Category of each applications that available in play store.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rating** - Play Store ratings for apps showing the proportional number of 1-5 star reviews, are calculated based on the app's current quality ratings from user reviews, rather than the lifetime average value of user reviews, unless the app has very few ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reviews** - App reviews are the individual comments users can leave under an app.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Size** - The amount of space required to install your app.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Installs** - The number of times the app was installed from the store regardless to any events in the past.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Content Rating** - Content ratings are used to describe the minimum maturity level of content in apps. However, content ratings don't tell you whether an app is designed for users of a specific age. Ratings are typically based on a number of factors, including sexual content, violence, drugs, gambling, and profane language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Genres** - Google Play Store app genres refer to the different categories or types of apps available in the Google Play Store.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Current Versions** - The \"current versions\" of apps in the Google Play Store refer to the most up-to-date versions available for each app. App developers regularly release updates to improve the functionality, fix bugs, enhance security, and introduce new features. These updates ensure that users have access to the best possible experience with the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Android Versions** - When we refer to \"Android versions\" in the context of Google Play Store apps, it means the minimum and target Android versions specified by the app developers. Each Android app is designed to work on a specific range of Android operating system versions. The minimum Android version indicates the oldest version of the Android operating system that the app is compatible with, while the target Android version represents the version that the app is primarily optimized for.\n",

        "\n",
        "**App** - User reviews in the context of apps refer to the feedback and opinions shared by individuals who have used the app. These reviews are typically found in app stores like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, where users can rate and leave comments about their experiences with an app. User reviews play a significant role in helping other users make informed decisions about whether to download and use the app.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Translated_Review** - When we talk about \"user reviews translated reviews\" in the context of apps, it refers to the process of translating user reviews from one language to another. User reviews are an essential source of feedback and information for apps, and translating them allows app developers and users to understand and engage with reviews in different languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sentiment** - Sentiment analysis in the context of user reviews refers to the process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in the reviews.

It indicates whether the text contains subjective information based on individual perspectives rather than objective facts. Subjective sentences often convey personal feelings, beliefs, or views, while objective sentences tend to present factual information.\n",
